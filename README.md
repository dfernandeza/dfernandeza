<h1>Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel Fernández</h1>

<p>👨🏻‍💻 Software Developer</p>

<p>
  I've been in the software engineering world for 15+ years, working with everything from small startups to big-name industry players.
</p>
  
</p> 
  I spent some of those years traveling, diving into different tech scenes and working for incredible companies. I've had the privilege of working across different markets, both in Europe and the Americas, gaining valuable insights into the unique challenges and opportunities that each region offers. This global perspective has enriched my approach to problem-solving, leadership and software development in general.
</p>

<p>
  I really enjoy creating web apps that not only look great but also hit business goals and deliver what users need. I enjoy solving tricky problems with creative solutions.
