<h1>Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel Fernández</h1>

<p>👨🏻‍💻 Web/Frontend Developer</p>

<p>
  I have been doing software engineering for 10+ years, during which I have gained valuable knowledge and experience developing and architecting web applications for small, medium and large sized companies.
  I really enjoy crafting high-quality web applications and I will be happy to jump and learn new technologies at any moment.

<p>
  I also enjoy and have experience leading engineering teams and working with stakeholders to build successful software products.
