<h1>Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel Fernández</h1>

  I have been doing software engineering for 10+ years, during which I have gained valuable knowledge and experience developing and architecting web applications for small, medium and large sized companies.

  I have worked with many different technologies throughout all the layers of software development although, I have always been particularly interested in the front end.
