<h1>Hey! 👋 I'm Daniel Fernández</h1>

<p>👨🏻‍💻 Web/Frontend Developer</p>

<p>
  I've been doing software engineering for 10+ years, during which I have gained valuable knowledge and experience developing and architecting web applications for small, medium and large sized companies.
  I really enjoy creating high-quality web applications using tools like React and NodeJS but I will be happy to jump and learn new technologies at any moment.
</p>

<p>
I've had the privilege of working across different markets, both in Europe and the Americas, gaining valuable insights into the unique challenges and opportunities that each region offers. This global perspective has enriched my approach to problem-solving and software development.``
</p>

<p>
  I also enjoy and have experience leading engineering teams and working with stakeholders to build successful software products.
